            <p>Ado (born October 24, 2002) is a Japanese singer. In 2020, at the age of 17, 
                she made her debut with the digital single titled "Usseewa",
                 which peaked at number 1 on Billboard Japan Hot 100, 
                 Oricon Digital Singles Chart, and the Oricon Streaming Chart. The song reached
                  100 million plays on Billboard Japan after 17 weeks from charting-in, which was
                   the sixth fastest in history and the youngest for a solo singer. 
                   In 2022, her song, "New Genesis", was used as the theme song for the anime
                    film One Piece Film: Red, and topped Apple Music's Global Top 100 charts.

                She currently belongs to the artist management company Cloud Nine.</p>
            <p>Ado previously released her debut studio album, Ky≈çgen, in January 2022. 
                The album broke previously set records in Japan, most notably becoming 
                the first debut studio album by a solo female artist to debut at number 
                one since Miwa's 2011 album, Guitarissimo.

                On June 8, the cast for the upcoming film, One Piece Film: 
                Red was revealed. Amongst the cast, Ado was revealed as the 
                singing voice actress for the character Uta while Kaori Nazuka 
                reprised her role for Uta's non-singing parts. A single titled 
                "New Genesis" was announced for release later that month, produced 
                by Mrs. Green Apple, Vaundy, Fake Type, Hiroyuki Sawano and 
                Yuta Orisaka were amongst those announced providing songs for 
                the soundtrack album. On June 15, the album art was revealed, drawn 
                by Eiichiro Oda. "New Genesis" topped Apple Music's Top 100: Global playlist,
                 a first for a Japanese song. Shortly after the release of "New Genesis",
                  a second single titled "I'm Invincible" was announced alongside its music video,
                   which was released on June 22. The third and final single "Backlight" was
                    released on July 6, 2022. "Fleeting Lullaby" later was released as a 
                    promotional single, days before the release of the album.</p>
